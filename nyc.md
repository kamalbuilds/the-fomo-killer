Of course! I can help you with the application for the Code NYC hackathon. Based on your project's `README.md` and the hackathon's focus, here are the draft answers to the application questions.

*

### 1. What are you planning to build at the hackathon? Tell us about the product, project, or prototype you're focused on. Be as specific as you can.

At Code NYC, we will enhance BasedAgents, our existing production-ready, multi-agent system built for secure onchain messaging and task automation on Base. BasedAgents is not a prototype; it's a sophisticated platform with a modular architecture featuring a central `MasterAgent` that orchestrates a suite of specialized agents, including:

*   `UtilityAgent`: For event planning and payment splitting.
*   `TradingAgent`: For portfolio management and token swaps.
*   `GameAgent`: For interactive, multiplayer games with a betting system.
*   `SocialAgent`: For content curation and news aggregation.

Our plan for the hackathon is to focus on building out features that align directly with the prize categories, transforming BasedAgents into a platform for revenue-generating and data-driven onchain experiences.

Specifically, we will:
1.  Monetize AI Agents: We will integrate Coinbase's x402 protocol into our `GameAgent` and `SocialAgent`. This will enable pay-to-play games with instant, onchain prize payouts and allow us to offer premium, data-driven crypto insights as a paid service.

2.  Enhance Smart Wallet Commerce: We will integrate the Smart Wallet to create a frictionless commerce experience within our `TradingAgent`. Users will be able to execute token swaps, manage their portfolio, and interact with DeFi protocols seamlessly from within a chat conversation, without needing to manually sign every transaction.

3.  Build an Onchain Checkout Flow: We will extend our `UtilityAgent` to support group purchases for things like event tickets or NFTs, leveraging the Onramp SDK for easy funding and Smart Wallet for a one-click onchain checkout experience.

By the end of the hackathon, BasedAgents will be a powerful demonstration of how AI agents can create user-friendly, monetizable, and truly useful onchain applications.

### 2. How will you use a Coinbase Developer Platform product in your build? Mention specific tools — Wallets, Onramp, x402, AgentKit, etc — and how they'll power your product.

Our project, BasedAgents, is fundamentally built on and deeply integrated with the Coinbase Developer Platform. Our plan for the hackathon is to deepen this integration significantly.

Existing CDP Integrations:
*   AgentKit: This is the core framework for our entire system. We use it to build, orchestrate, and manage our specialized agents, defining their tools and logic for onchain interactions.
*   OnchainKit: We use OnchainKit to power our frontend components and for various blockchain interactions on the Base network.
*   Base: All our agent operations and smart contract interactions are deployed on the Base network, making it our primary execution layer.

Planned Hackathon Integrations:
*   Smart Wallet: We will integrate Smart Wallet to abstract away transaction complexities for our users. This is critical for creating the seamless, wallet-native experiences we envision for our `TradingAgent` (for swaps) and `GameAgent` (for betting), enabling interactions without constant signature pop-ups.
*   Onramp SDK: To address user onboarding, we will use the Onramp SDK to allow users to fund their wallets with fiat directly within our application. This removes a major point of friction for new users entering the onchain ecosystem.
*   x402 Protocol: We see x402 as the key to monetization. We will use it to create onchain, pay-per-use APIs for our agents. For example, the `GameAgent` will use x402 for pay-to-play game entry fees and automated payouts, and the `SocialAgent` will use it to gate premium market analysis reports.
*   Coinbase Wallet & SDK: We will use the Coinbase Wallet SDK to ensure users have a secure and familiar way to connect to BasedAgents, further enhancing trust and usability.

By combining these tools, we will showcase a powerful, vertically-integrated application built entirely on the CDP stack, from user onboarding and wallet management to agent-driven onchain commerce.

### 3. What is your go-to-market plan for launching your app?

Our go-to-market plan is structured in three phases, designed to build a strong community, drive adoption through partnerships, and scale sustainably.

Phase 1: Community-Led Launch (Months 0-3)
*   Target Audience: Our initial focus is on crypto-native users who are active on Base, particularly traders, members of DAOs, and users of platforms like Farcaster.
*   Community Building: We will leverage our Discord and social media channels to engage early adopters. We'll share demos, tutorials, and use cases to showcase the power of BasedAgents.
*   Launch: We plan a coordinated launch on platforms like Product Hunt and X (Twitter) to generate initial buzz and attract our first wave of users.

Phase 2: Growth through Partnerships & Integrations (Months 3-9)
*   B2B2C Strategy: We will partner with other projects and communities on Base. For example, DeFi protocols can integrate our `TradingAgent` for their users, or gaming guilds can use our `GameAgent` to host community events. We will position BasedAgents as an "agent-as-a-service" platform.
*   Content Marketing: We will establish thought leadership by creating in-depth content (blog posts, videos, tutorials) that showcases how to build and leverage AI agents for onchain applications.

Phase 3: Monetization and Platform Expansion (Months 9+)
*   Premium Features: We will roll out monetized, premium features for our agents using the x402 protocol, such as advanced trading analytics, automated portfolio strategies, or unlimited access to our gaming suite.
*   Developer Platform: Our long-term vision is to open up BasedAgents as a platform, allowing other developers to build, deploy, and monetize their own specialized agents, creating a vibrant ecosystem and new revenue streams.
*   Multi-Chain Expansion: Based on user feedback and demand, we will strategically expand support for other EVM-compatible chains.

### 4. Why should we select you to be part of Code NYC?

You should select us (BasedAgents) for Code NYC because we embody the hackathon's core principle: we are building a real product, not just a prototype.

1.  We Are Shippers with a Product-Ready App: We aren't starting from an idea on a napkin. We have an existing, functional, and well-architected multi-agent system that is already live. The detailed documentation, comprehensive test suites, and CI/CD pipeline outlined in our repository demonstrate our commitment to engineering excellence and our ability to execute.

2.  Deeply Aligned with the Coinbase Ecosystem: Our project is a testament to the power of the Coinbase Developer Platform. We have already integrated `AgentKit`, `OnchainKit`, and `Base` at a fundamental level. Our hackathon plan is to go even deeper, adopting `Smart Wallet`, `Onramp`, and `x402` to build the exact kind of wallet-native, revenue-generating applications you are looking for. We are not just using CDP tools; we are showcasing a vision for what a fully-integrated CDP application can look like.

3.  Strong Vision and a Clear Plan: We have a clear vision for BasedAgents to become the go-to platform for agent-driven commerce and automation onchain. Our specific hackathon goals and our well-articulated GTM strategy show that we have thought deeply about our product, our users, and our path to building a sustainable business.

We are the technical, product-minded builders you are looking for. We have the foundation, the vision, and the expertise to make the most of this opportunity and ship a product that the community will find genuinely useful.
